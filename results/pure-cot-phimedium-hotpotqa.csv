On the other hand, the context for Camlaren Mine mentions that ""conditions attributed to World War II"" halted its development. While World War II was not a natural disaster, it was an event that significantly impacted the mine's operations.

Given the options provided, neither mine was explicitly halted by a natural disaster. However, if we must choose between the two, the Camlaren Mine's development was halted due to external conditions, which could be considered more disruptive than the fire at Barton Mine. Therefore, the answer would be 'Camlaren Mine', but it is important to note that the context does not mention a natural disaster as the cause of the halt. ### Camlaren Mine <|end|>",barton mine,"Barton Mine, also known as Net Lake Mine, is an abandoned surface and underground mine in Northeastern Ontario, Canada.
